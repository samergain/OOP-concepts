/*
 Designing and Building Classes using object-oriented principles
1. Write a program that that demonstrates use of four basic principles of
object-oriented programming /Abstraction/, /Encapsulation/, /Inheritance/ and
/Polymorphism/.
2. Use /Abstraction/ to define different classes for each person type such as Student
and Instructor. These classes should have behavior for that type of person.
3. Use /Encapsulation/ to keep many details private in each class.
4. Use /Inheritance/ by leveraging the implementation already created in the Person
class to save code in Student and Instructor classes.
5. Use /Polymorphism/ to create virtual methods that derived classes could override to
create specific behavior such as salary calculations.
6. Make sure to create appropriate /interfaces/ such as ICourseService, IStudentService,
IInstructorService, IDepartmentService, IPersonService, IPersonService (should have
person specific methods). IStudentService, IInstructorService should inherit from
IPersonService.
Person
Calculate Age of the Person
Calculate the Salary of the person, Use decimal for salary
Salary cannot be negative number
Can have multiple Addresses, should have method to get addresses
Instructor
Belongs to one Department and he can be Head of the Department
Instructor will have added bonus salary based on his experience, calculate his
years of experience based on Join Date
Student
Can take multiple courses
Calculate student GPA based on grades for courses
Each course will have grade from A to F
Course
Will have list of enrolled students
Department
Will have one Instructor as head
Will have Budget for school year (start and end Date Time)
Will offer list of courses
